# BLE_DMM_Client
Bluetooth Multimeter Client
## Support Models
Aneng 9002, BSIDE ZT-300AB, ZOYI ZT-300AB
(BK3432 BT5.0 with 11 Byte Data)
Just tested with ZOYI ZT-300AB. This solution is very cheap, I just bought a new one by 85 RMB (~ 13 USD).
This is the cheapest with capability to connect with Mobile Phone or Computer. They officially provide Mobile Phone vsersion. So I just open this project for fun.
